    "## Setting Up Virtual Environments\n",
    "\n",
    "As you do data science projects, you will spend a lot of your time using pre-written libraries to speed up your development - like numpy, pandas, or scikit-learn. As you work on different projects, you may also find that you use different versions of different libraries for different projects. The most common versioning issue is that some projects will run in Python 2 whereas others will run in Python 3, but you may also find that different projects depend on different versions of libraries like Tensorflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "Occasionally, code that works in an old version of a library won’t work in a newer version. So if you open up a new project and install the dependencies, it’s possible that your old project won’t work anymore.\n",
    "\n",
    "To avoid that problem, a best practice is to use “virtual environments”. Virtual environments allow you to have different versions of Python and different versions of the various libraries you use, so you can install a new version of a library for one project but still use the old version for another project. It’s almost as if you have multiple computers that you can swap between, each having a different setup and configuration, just by running a couple of commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a built-in virtual environment feature in Python, but we’re going to use the more flexible virtual environments provided by Conda as part of the Anaconda distribution you installed.\n",
    "\n",
    "To use a new virtual environment, there are two steps you need to complete. The first step is to create the virtual environment. That may take a couple of minutes as your computer has to download the necessary version of Python and all of the libraries that you want to be able to use in that environment. The next step then is to “use” the virtual environment by activating it.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you want to learn more about Conda environments, have a look at the <a href=\"https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html\" target=\"_blank\">documentation</a>, otherwise, let’s give this a try."
